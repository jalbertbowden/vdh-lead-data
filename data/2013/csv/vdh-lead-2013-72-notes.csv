Note,Description
Note:,"2010 U.S. Census Population Data were used.  Results based on one test per child per year.  A confirmed elevated blood lead level (EBLL) is defined as a single elevated venous test â‰¥ 10 ug/dL or two elevated capillary tests within 84 days / 12 weeks and is only counted once in the year in which it initially occurred.  The reporting of elevated blood lead levels is required under the Regulations for Disease Reporting and Control.  These statistics are preliminary, as the database will accept historical data as made available and continuous data quality control may depict minor changes in data."
