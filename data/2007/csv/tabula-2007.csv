Guidelines for Childhood Lead Poisoning Testing 
ALL MEDICAID ENROLLED CHILDREN ARE REQUIRED TO BE TESTED 
AT 1 AND 2 YEARS OF AGE 
"To determine risk for other children, please use the chart below. "
 OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR CHILDREN 
Blood lead levels shall be obtained in children at ages 1 and 2 if they meet ANY one of 
"the criteria noted in the box below. In addition, children ages 3-5 years of age who have "
"not previously been tested, and moved to a new address in a high-risk area, or meet "
ANY one of the criteria in the box below shall also be tested.  
1. Eligible for or receiving WIC benefits? Medicaid eligible and not tested at both 1 and 2 years 
of age? 
2. Living in a ZIP Code determined to be high-risk based on age of housing and other factors? 
(See attached High – Risk ZIP Code list) 
3. Living in or regularly visiting a house or day care center built before 1950? 
4. Living in or regularly visiting a house built before 1978 with peeling or chipping paint or 
"recent (within the last 6 months), ongoing or planned renovation? "
"5. Living with or regularly visiting a sibling, housemate or playmate with lead poisoning? "
6. Living with an adult whose job or hobby involves exposure to lead? 
"7. Living near an active lead smelter, battery recycling plant, or other industry likely to release "
lead? 
"8. Recent refugee, immigrant, or child adopted from outside of the U.S. "
venous sample is considered “confirmed” and required for environmental investigations.  
Virginia regulations require reporting of blood lead levels ≥10 μg/dL (using the EPI-1 form) to the Office of Epidemiology. 
Regulations 12 VAC 5-120 require laboratories and point of care providers using CLIA-waived devices to report all blood lead 
tests on children under the age of six within ten days of analysis. 
MANAGEMENT OF CHILDREN WITH CONFIRMED 
 ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS  
BLOOD LEAD ACTION TIME FRAME 
 (LμEVEL (Case manager assures coordinated action and follow-up) (Begin g/dL) intervention) 
10-14 • Provide caregiver lead education: dietary and environmental  
• Follow-up blood lead testing within 30 days to assure not rising 
"• Within 30 days Refer for WIC and social services, if needed "
"15-19 • Above actions, plus: "
• Proceed according to actions for 20-40 ug/dL if: A follow-up blood Within 2 weeks 
"lead is 15 or above, or the blood lead level is increasing "
"20-44 • Above actions, plus: "
• Provide coordination of care (case management)  
• Within 1 week Provide environmental investigation and control lead hazards 
45-69 • Above actions Within 48 hours 
"70 and above • Above actions, plus: • Hospitalize child and begin medical treatment (chelation therapy as "
appropriate) immediately.  Within 24 hours 
• Contact Emergency Lead Healthcare line below. 
Current CDC management recommendations adapted from Managing Elevated Blood Lead Levels Among Young 
"Children: Recommendations from the Advisory Committee on Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention. (CDC, 2002). "
* Investigations may be required where babies or multiple children in a household have elevated blood lead levels. Follow –up 
care is described in more detail in the VDH “Care Coordination Manual: Children with Lead Poisoning in Virginia”.
