Note: Results based on one test per child per year.  The reporting of elevated blood lead levels is required under the Regulations for Disease Reporting and Control.  
"Effective July 1, 2001, regulations require the reporting of all lead tests performed on children under 72 months of age.  The number of children tested each year is "
"influenced by several factors that include the number of children born in Virginia each year, migration of children into and out of the state or to a different locality, "
"and the number of children tested in compliance with the regulations. These statistics are preliminary, as the database will accept historical data as made available "
and continuous data quality control may depict minor changes.

Guidelines for Childhood Lead Poisoning Testing 
ALL MEDICAID ENROLLED CHILDREN ARE REQUIRED TO BE TESTED AT 1 AND 
YEARS OF AGE 
"To determine risk for other children, please use the chart below. "
 OTHER RISK FACTORS FOR CHILDREN 
Blood lead levels shall be obtained in children at ages 1 and 2 if they meet ANY one of the criteria noted 
"in the box below. In addition, children ages 3-5 years of age who have not previously been tested, and "
"moved to a new address in a high-risk area, or meet ANY one of the criteria in the box below shall also be "
tested.  
1. Eligible for or receiving WIC benefits? Medicaid eligible and not tested at both 1 and 2 years of age? 
2. Living in a ZIP Code determined to be high-risk based on age of housing and other factors? (See attached High – 
Risk ZIP Code list) 
3. Living in or regularly visiting a house or day care center built before 1950? 
4. Living in or regularly visiting a house built before 1978 with peeling or chipping paint or recent (within the last 6 
"months), ongoing or planned renovation? "
"5. Living with or regularly visiting a sibling, housemate or playmate with lead poisoning? "
6. Living with an adult whose job or hobby involves exposure to lead? 
"7. Living near an active lead smelter, battery recycling plant, or other industry likely to release lead? "
"8. Recent refugee, immigrant, or child adopted from outside of the U.S. "
• Take careful history regarding possible lead exposure at each routine visit. 
• A child must be tested if the parent or guardian requests testing due to possible exposure (12 VAC 5-120).
