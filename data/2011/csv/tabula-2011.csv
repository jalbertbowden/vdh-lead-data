Note: Results based on one test per child per year.  The reporting of elevated blood lead levels is required under the Regulations for Disease Reporting and Control.  
"Effective July 1, 2001, regulations require the reporting of all lead tests performed on children under 72 months of age by CLIA approved laboratories.  The number "
"of children reported tested each year is influenced by several factors that include the number of children born in Virginia each year, migration of children into and out "
"of the state or to a different locality, and the number of children tested and reported in compliance with the regulations. These statistics are preliminary, as the "
database will accept historical data as made available and continuous data quality control may depict minor changes.

Note: A „confirmed‟ elevated blood lead level (EBLL) is defined as a single elevated venous test  10 g/dL or two elevated capillary tests within 
84 days/12 weeks performed by a CLIA approved lab and is only counted once in the year in which it initially occurred.  The reporting of 
"elevated blood lead levels is required under the Regulations for Disease Reporting and Control.  Effective July 1, 2001, regulations require the "
"reporting of all blood lead tests performed on children under 72 months of age by CLIA-approved laboratories. These statistics are preliminary, "

Note: Environmental intervention blood lead investigations are performed on all confirmed venous elevated blood lead levels  20 µg/dL or persistent confirmed 
blood lead levels of 15 to 19 µg/dL on children < 72 months of age.  Environmental investigations / risk assessments not conducted or completed were due to varying 
reasons such as the family moved to a new address or the family refused inspection.  Multiple environmental investigations may be required for the same child due to 
"the possibility of lead exposure from more than one location, and risk assessments may not agree with 2011 EBLLs reported, as overlap into the following year may "
occur. Each source of exposure (dust etc.) was only counted once per address.

Note: 2010 U.S. Census Population Data were used.  Results based on one test per child per year.  A confirmed elevated blood lead level (EBLL) is defined as a single elevated venous test  10 g/dL or two elevated capillary 
"tests within 84 days/12 weeks and is only counted once in the year in which it initially occurred.  The reporting of elevated blood lead levels is required under the Regulations for Disease Reporting and Control.  Effective July 1, "
"2001, regulations require the reporting of all lead tests performed on children under 72 months of age.  The number of children tested each year is influenced by several factors that include the number of children born in Virginia "
"each year, migration of children into and out of the state or to a different locality, and the number of children tested  in compliance with the regulations.  Regulations only require testing at 1 and 2 years of age if determined to be "
"at risk.  These statistics are preliminary, as the database will accept historical data as made available and continuous data quality control may depict minor changes in data. "
