Note,Description
Note:,"2000 U.S. Census Population Data were used. Results based on one test per child per year. A confirmed elevated blood lead level (EBLL) is defined as a single elevated venous test ≥ 10 µg/dL or two elevated capillary tests within 84 days/12 weeks and is only counted once in the year in which it initially occurred. The reporting of elevated blood lead levels is required under the Regulations for Disease Reporting and Control. Effective July 1, 2001, regulations require the reporting of all lead tests performed on children under 72 months of age. The number of children tested each year is influenced by several factors that include the number of children born in Virginia each year, migration of children into and out of the state or to a different locality, and the number of children tested in compliance with the regulations. ^ Regulations only require testing at 1 and 2 years of age if determined to be at risk. These statistics are preliminary, as the database will accept historical data as made available and continuous data quality control may depict minor changes."
